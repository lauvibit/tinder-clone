Simple (MERN) Tinder-clone for practicing databases and API calls.

Here a few things I used with this project:

- Axios for http requests from node.js
- react-tinder-card component
- @material-ui components (icons and button click effect)
- CORS
- API calls from backend hosted on Heroku
- Using MongoDB to pull data
